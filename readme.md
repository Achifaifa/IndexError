An attempt to make Python's IndexError exception strings more useful  
This project is still a work in progress  

###Files and folders

###Compiling  

* go to `python-2.7.10` and run the `configure` script
* run `make` to compile the source code

If you just want to try it out, you can launch the compiled binary with `python` to get the interpreter  
If you want to install the modified version of python in your system, type `make install`
